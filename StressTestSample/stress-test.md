# Stress Test Sample

![](../Images/stresstest_sample.png)

This sample provides you with a simple scene where you can spawn X amount of characters that move in circles. There are also options for switching the level prefab, and tweaking various character settings that commonly affect performance.

**StressTestManager** handles all the logic in this sample (character spawning, options tweaking, etc...), besides the actual character system.
