# Standard Characters & Cameras

Rival comes with a "StandardCharacters" folder containing a "StandardCharacter_FirstPerson.unityPackage" and a "StandardCharacter_ThirdPerson.unityPackage". These packages contain the scripts & prefabs required for basic plug-n-play first person and third person character controllers, along with their cameras & rudimentary input handling. You can extract the packages into your project, and start customizing the characters & cameras from that starting point.
