# Getting Started

Here are the recommended first steps you should take with Rival:
1. Finish reading this whole page
1. Install the [Samples](./samples.md) project (installation details are on the Samples page) and play around with the various samples.
1. Follow the [Tutorial](./tutorial.md) from start to finish. This will show you how to setup a DOTS project correctly, and teach you how to create characters with Rival.


## Creating New Character Controllers 

In Rival, there are two main ways of creating your character controller:

#### Using the Character Controller Wizard

The Character Controller Wizard is a window that allows you to generate all the files necessary for the creation of a new character controller. It can be accessed through Unity's top bar menu: `Window > Rival > Character Controller Wizard`.

The workflow looks like this:
- Generate the code for your new character by using the Character Controller Wizard. 
- Add the generated character authoring component to a GameObject.
- Customize the character's implementation inside of the generated files, and/or in extra systems.

You can specify the name, namespace (optional), and path of the generated character controller files, and an info box gives you a preview of what exactly will be generated. Once you've entered a name, namespace, and path, click the "Generate" button to create the files.

See [Code Structure](./Core/code-structure.md) for an overview of what the generated files do.

#### Using the Standard Characters & Cameras as a Starting Point

The [Standard Characters](./standard-characters.md) downloadable package contains pre-made FirstPerson & ThirdPerson characters and cameras. You can add these to your project as a starting point, and start customizing them to your liking.

These characters are very similar to those generated by the Character Controller Wizard, but they come with default input & camera handling as well as drag-n-drop prefabs to make your life easier.
