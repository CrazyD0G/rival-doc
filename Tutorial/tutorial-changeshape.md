# Tutorial - Change Collision Shape

Changing the character physics shape is as simple as changing the "Shape Type" in the `PhysicsShape` component of the character GameObject. The only limitation is that it must be a convex shape (all primitives are convex). You can try changing the shape to a "Cylinder" here for example, and this new shape will be taken into account.
